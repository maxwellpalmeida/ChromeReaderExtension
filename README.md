# ChromeExtensionReader

Keep your pace reading pages!
Ever wished to know where you halted your reading on a webpage and had to search on the text to continue were you left off? Well, I did. That's why I built this simple yet helpfull extension that stores were you left off your reading, and resumes when you open that page again. Whether you open it again tomorrow, next week or next month.
